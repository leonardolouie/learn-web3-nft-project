# Learn Web3 NFT Project

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a basic NFT project using Solidity, Truffle, and Ganache.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Truffle - Framework for smart contract development.
- Ganache - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
- Infura - Ethereum blockchain node provider.
- MetaMask - Web3 wallet for interacting with Ethereum.

## Running the Application Locally

You can use Truffleâ€™s built-in development environment to compile, migrate, and test your contracts on a local Ganache instance.

### Start Truffle Development Console

To open the Truffle development console and spin up a local blockchain, run the following command:

```bash
truffle develop
```

### Compile the Contracts

Once the console is open, you can compile your contracts by running:

```bash
truffle compile
```

## Migrate the Contracts

To deploy your contracts on the local development blockchain, run:

```bash
truffle migrate
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for your contracts, you can use the following command in the Truffle console or your terminal:

```bash
truffle test
```
